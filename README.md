# Xqhare
Hello there, I am Xqhare, a self-taught programmer with a passion for systems programming and everything I can break!

My journey started in Minecraft with the mod "ComputerCraft" where I programmed an autominer. After some tinkering I still remember the excitement when I finally got it to move, only to realize I had put in two variables the wrong way around and the autominer started digging straight down instead of forwards.

After this I enrolled in the media course in my high-school and continued with some classical education in JavaScript and MySQL during A-levels. I spend a few semesters studying IT-Security where I had first experience with using Linux and writing bash. After dropping out I transitioned to using Python and started the randomiserProject you can find in my repos.

Delving deeper and deeper into the arcane knowledge that is computer science, I now have hopped onto the rust train and can't get off, it's just too BLAZINGLY FAST!

Alongside my programming journey, I have also switched to using Linux as my main operating system. During that transition I have also picked up neovim as my code editor.

## My projects

Most of my projects are written with the goal in mind, to create a fully functional ecosystem of libraries and tools that I can use to build other projects.
I do this not because "I can write something better", but because, as I do this as a hobby, I want to learn things I don't know.

Because of this I operate under the `no external dependencies` rule, which means I generally can't use any libraries that are not written by me.
I allow myself full use of rusts standard library - I personally count the [`futures crate`](https://crates.io/crates/futures) crate as part of this.

The one exception is the `libc` crate, which I use to access the C standard library.

### External dependencies still in use (until I can get rid of them)

- [signal-hook](https://crates.io/crates/signal-hook) for signal handling
- [unicode-segmentation](https://crates.io/crates/unicode-segmentation) for string splitting
- [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui) for GUI - TUI is already in the works and in an almost usable-ish state [here](https://github.com/xqhare/talos)

## 🚀 About Me
- 👨‍💻 I'm self-taught in Rust and Python, with some classical education in JavaScript and MySQL.
- 💡 I'm a self-taught programmer, always eager to learn.
- 🔭 Currently, I'm solving problems only I have and make for myself.
- ✨ I'm creating bugs since first programming an autominer, using Lua, in a Minecraft mod called "ComputerCraft" sometime in the early 2010's.

## 💌 The quote I code by
"You copied that function without understanding why it does what it does, and as a result your code IS GARBAGE. AGAIN."

## 🌟 Featured Projects
Get a glimpse of the projects I've been working on:

---

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Xqhare&repo=nabu&theme=radical)
 
Nabu us a rust library to interact with .xff files. .xff files are my own specification of a json like binary data structure capable of storing arbitrary data.

---

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Xqhare&repo=tyche&theme=radical)

You always need random data. Part of my effort to build my own code stack.

---

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Xqhare&repo=athena&theme=radical)

Athena is a collection of small, but useful code like compression and checksums. It is also home to my most used piece of code, `XffValue`.

---
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Xqhare&repo=urd&theme=radical)

Urd is my first fully finished GUI Application.

---
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=Xqhare&repo=horae&theme=radical)

Everybody always talks about how hard Time & Date is. I had to find out myself, and yes, they are right.

## ⭐ GitHub Stats
I found these, so of course I need to include them:

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api?username=Xqhare&show_icons=true&theme=radical)
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/streak?username=Xqhare&theme=radical)
![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats-fast.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Xqhare&layout=compact&theme=radical)

## 🎯 Future Goals
My future goals include:

- Continuing to build projects and experiment.
- Expanding my code base with more libraries, so that I don't need to use any external dependencies. At some point.

## 🌈 Fun Facts by me!

"What would change if you could only ever create an object once?" - "Nothing for most object oriented programmers!"

`libc` is one of the few pieces of software, that is neither a dependency, nor part of the environment, but also both at the same time.
